In this paper we describe the difference between informal comments, posted on social networks, and internet texts  journalistic style which tend to be written in a standard Russian, often referred as Codified Literary Russian. We performed a quantitative analysis of more than 180 graphic, morphological and syntactic features and those features that turned out to be statistically significant got a linguistic explanation. The main contribution of our work is as follows: the peculiarity of the electronically mediated comments is not grounded in misspelling, abnormal punctuation and lexical innovations, but embraces all levels of the language, including morphology and syntax. We assume that the differences between the language of comments and the codified literary Russian arise as a result of some underlying strategies. These trends are: economy (people tend to spare speech resources), sense distribution (people tend to put one thought in one phrase), compensation (people often try to add information that is usually not transmitted under writing). Some of these strategies are also used under the generation of spoken language, which explains the well-known similarity between spoken language and many texts on the Internet.
